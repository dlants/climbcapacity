# TODO
- extract the fuzzy-find filter to a separate view, use it in the explore page and the report card page
- hook up unit selection for report card page & explore page
- display measureStats next to measure filters
- exclude empty or almost-empty filters from default input filters on the explore page
- responsive ui for phones

# MAYBE
- think about a different architecture other than ELM. Maybe something more self-contained, with message passing.
- convert to mithril
